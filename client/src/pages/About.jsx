      <p className="is-size-5">Thank you so much for stopping by! My name is <strong><i>Beck</i></strong>, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you on exciting projects in the future!</p>
      <br />
      <p className="is-size-5">Born and raised on the east coast, I've cultivated a spirit of resilience and adaptability from an early age. From publishing books as a child to spending two years living in a makeshift tent, I've embraced every experience as an opportunity for growth and learning. With a proven track record of success and a dedication to continuous improvement, I am eager to embark on the next chapter of my professional journey.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="is-size-5">With a rich tapestry of experiences ranging from aviation management to software engineering, I bring a versatile skill set and a passion for excellence to every endeavor.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="is-size-5">In my tenure as a staff supervisor at Avflight Corporation, I orchestrated the smooth operation of the KDRO location, overseeing a dedicated team of 10-15 professionals. From managing inventories to nurturing customer relationships, my leadership ensured that every aspect of our operations ran seamlessly. By prioritizing exceptional service and maintaining meticulous attention to detail, I not only contributed to cultivating a loyal customer base but also upheld stringent safety standards, ensuring that all aircraft were serviced promptly and efficiently.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="is-size-5">My journey extends beyond aviation into the realm of software engineering, where I am currently pursuing certification from the University of Denver. Proficient in full-stack web development and adept at problem-solving in fast-paced environments, I bring a dynamic perspective to every coding challenge. With a background that spans customer service, line technician roles, and pharmacy technician certification, I possess a robust foundation in data management, invoicing, and delivering unparalleled customer experiences.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="is-size-5">Driven by a relentless pursuit of growth and development, I thrive in diverse settings and embrace new challenges with enthusiasm. Whether navigating the intricacies of aviation logistics or delving into the complexities of software development, I approach each opportunity with a can-do attitude and a commitment to excellence.</p>
